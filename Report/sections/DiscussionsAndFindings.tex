\subsection{Future Works}
We have identified several areas that can be further developed in future iterations. Firstly, we could implement and verify additional treap methods such as "union‚Äù. Secondly, the current implementation can only store integer values as keys. We can work to make the Treap data structure generic, allowing keys to be any comparable type, thus providing more flexibility and versatility to the user. Lastly, we can refactor the "Valid" predicate of TreapNode into separate "Valid", "ValidBst", "ValidHeap", and "ValidTree". This will help optimize the verification process by reducing unnecessary computations and making the naming scheme more sensible.\\
